👀 I have a strong interest in web development and I'm always exploring creative ways to combine these passions.

🌱 Currently, I'm delving into basic web development techniques.

💼 My technical skills include proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, Git, and Node.js, and I'm continuously expanding my toolkit with new languages and technologies.

💞️ I’m excited to work on any new project that comes my way.
